<p>Our Services display some content that is not zan games’s. This content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available.

<p>Some of our Services are available on mobile devices. Do not use such Services in a way that distracts you and prevents you from obeying traffic or safety laws.</p>
<h2 id="Your-ZAN-GAMES-Account"><a href="#Your-ZAN-GAMES-Account" class="headerlink" title="Your ZAN GAMES Account"></a>Your ZAN GAMES Account</h2><p>You may need a ZAN GAMES Account in order to use some of our Services.

<p>When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or through our Services, you give ZAN GAMES (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes we make so that your content works better with our Services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content.
